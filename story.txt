Long ago, in a very beatiful beach there were the souls of a women and a child roaming around the beach at evening and at night.
One day there came a man in the beach at night ato enjoy the sunset and see the stars. he was in a very happy mood because he just got a promotion in the office.
That time there was a sound coming from the bushes at the corner of the beach that someone help me!!!!!!!!. At first the man ignored the voice, but it was coming continously so he want to check.
There was a old man also sitting at the beach he told not to go and help her once a young boy went to help her but there was the body of the boy thrown at the beach with full of blood around him.
